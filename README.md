This challenge consists of 24 daily coding exercises designed to test and improve my frontend web development skills in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It is based on the Advent of Code challenge, which releases daily coding challenges throughout the month of December.

I will be documenting my journey through the Advent of Frontend challenge on my personal blog.

I am looking forward to the opportunity to practice and improve my skills in these essential technologies for frontend development, and to complete a series of daily coding exercises to focus on my coding skills and work on improving my efficiency and problem-solving abilities.

Throughout the Advent of Frontend challenge, I will be sharing my progress and experiences on my blog. I hope that by doing so, I can not only document my own journey and learning process, but also inspire and motivate others to take on similar challenges and improve their own frontend skills. Additionally, blogging about the challenge will help me to stay accountable and motivated to complete all 24 challenges, and provide a platform for me to share any insights or lessons learned along the way.

If you are also participating in the Advent of Frontend challenge, or any challenge at all, I would love to hear from you. Feel free to connect with me on social media to share your progress and experiences. I am excited to get started on this new challenge and can't wait to see what I will learn and accomplish over the next few weeks. Follow my journey on my blog to stay updated.
